# Creates recurring issues within JIRA
# - Title of the issue contains [RECURRING]
# - Task description contains recurring_settings[active, schedule_type, scedule, times_recurred]
# - A new issue will be made even if the last is not yet done. Therefore you notice you"re skipping
# - Note: [RECURRING] will be renamed to [RECURRED]. So there should only be one [RECURRING]
# - For each issue title, only one recurring issue will be created (otherwise it"ll be recursive)

# Example task description:
# recurring_settings:[
# active:1
# schedule_type:interval
# schedule:1
# times_recurred:0]

# Note: schedule_type allows interval or weekday
# Interval is in days since last issue creation
# weekdays is a comma separated list 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 where monday is 1. It'll recur on these days
